# FuncBash

A functional-programming library for bash scripting.
---

Well, this is actually just a proof of concept of writing a bash library 
for functional programming in bash. Just having fun, and seeing how much 
can I stretch this before cheating and looking around at what others have
already done. And there is some things already done, as a quick google search shows.


TODO
---

I just wrote a list wrapper, a map function and  filter function.

Todo next could be a foldl and foldr functions, list comprehension,...
